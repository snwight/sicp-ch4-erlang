===============

did i mention this is a WIP!?

I spent some days fooling around with translating the code in Structure & Interpretation of Computer Programs[*]
Chapter 4.4, the logic programming interpreter, into an Erlang OTP style. I was interested in how fluid a
process that might be - I love both languages aesthetically and I'd been meaning to try exactly this for years.
I've pushed the halfbaked mess up to my github world for posterity's sake - work remaining all centers around
reimplementing the frame store in an Erlang style (currently half-done using ETS tables) rather than the hand-rolled
Scheme-centric versions in the text. Someday I shall return.
